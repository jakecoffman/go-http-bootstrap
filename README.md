go-http-bootstrap
=================

This bootstrap project shows examples of how to make a basic golang http server. 

It covers:

* Serving static files
* Writing arbitrary responses via Sprintf and casting a string to a []byte
* Using functions as handlers via HandleFunc
* Executing http/templates and passing data
* Custom middleware/filters via implementation of the http.Handler interface

And much much more! (assuming I forget to update this file)
